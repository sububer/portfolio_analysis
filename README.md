## Installation

You will need Python 3.7, that supports for this application to run. An easy way to install python 3.7 is to download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). After installing anaconda, open a terminal/command-prompt, and setup a python 3.7 environment, and then activate it like so:

```
# create an anaconda python 3.7 environment
# name can be any friendly name to refer to your environment, eg 'dev'
conda create --name dev python=3.7 anaconda

# activating the environment
conda activate dev
```

---

## Usage

The analysis is presented within a [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) notebook. To launch JupyterLab, from the root of this repo dirctory:

```
# within repo root 
$ jupyter lab
```
You can now open the notebook [risk_return_analysis.ipynb](./risk_return_analysis.ipynb) locally with JupyterLab.
